Answer data driven questions for an optimal launch of Ruckbuster's online video service regarding revenue, movie rentals and customers.

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The dataset used contained information about Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. This data analysed and queried using the postgreSQL server, and thereafter used to answer the following questions:

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
